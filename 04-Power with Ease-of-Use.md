At it's heart, MongoDB is a distributed system that was originally designed to be run with a default configuration inside replica sets known as clusters.

The default configuration of MongoDB provides a three-node replica set. All three nodes are data-bearing,  which means that there is a complete copy of the database available on each node.

Each database  is hosted on a separate instance or host, which can be in the same availability zone, data center, or  region. This default configuration is to ensure both redundancy and high availability.
